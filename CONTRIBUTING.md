the goaw o-of these guidewines i-is to impwove d-devewopew p-pwoductivity by a-awwowing
devewopews t-to jump into a-any fiwe in the c-codebase and nyot nyeed to adapt to
inconsistencies in how the code is wwitten. /(^•ω•^) t-the codebase shouwd appeaw as if it
had been authowed b-by a singwe devewopew. rawr x3 if y-you don't agwee with a convention, (U ﹏ U)
submit a pw patching this document a-and wet's discuss! (U ﹏ U) once the p-pw is accepted, (⑅˘꒳˘)
*aww* c-code shouwd be updated as soon as possibwe to wefwect the nyew
