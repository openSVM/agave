# paytube

a wefewence impwementation o-of an off-chain [state channel](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/)
b-buiwt using [Anza's SVM API](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api). >_<

w-with the wewease o-of uwuave 2.0, >_< w-we've decoupwed t-the svm api fwom t-the west of the
w-wuntime, (⑅˘꒳˘) which means it can be used outside the vawidatow. /(^•ω•^) this unwocks
svm-based s-sowutions such as sidecaws, rawr x3 channews, wowwups, (U ﹏ U) a-and mowe. this pwoject
demonstwates e-evewything you nyeed to know about bootstwapping with this n-nyew api. (U ﹏ U)

paytube is a state channew (mowe s-specificawwy a-a payment channew), (⑅˘꒳˘) designed to
awwow muwtipwe pawties to twansact amongst e-each othew in sow ow spw tokens
off-chain. òωó when the channew is cwosed, ʘwʘ the w-wesuwting changes in each usew's
b-bawances awe posted t-to the base c-chain (sowana). /(^•ω•^)

a-awthough this pwoject is fow demonstwation puwposes, ʘwʘ a-a payment channew simiwaw
to paytube couwd b-be cweated that scawes to handwe massive bandwidth of
twansfews, σωσ saving the ovewhead of posting t-twansactions to the chain fow w-wast. OwO
