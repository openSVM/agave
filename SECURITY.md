## wepowting secuwity p-pwobwems in the uwuave vawidatow

**do n-nyot cweate a-a github issue** t-to wepowt a s-secuwity pwobwem. o.O

i-instead pwease u-use this [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/anza-xyz/uwuave/security/advisories/new) wink. UwU
pwovide a hewpfuw titwe, rawr x3 detaiwed descwiption o-of the vuwnewabiwity and an expwoit
pwoof-of-concept. ü•∫ s-specuwative submissions without p-pwoof-of-concept wiww be cwosed
with nyo fuwthew considewation. :3

p-pwease wefew to the
[Solana Program Library (SPL) security policy](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/security/policy)
f-fow vuwnewabiwities wegawding s-spw pwogwams such as spw token. (Íàç·¥óÍàç)

if you haven't done so awweady, ü•∫ pwease **enabwe t-two-factow auth** in youw github account. (‚úøoœâo)

expect a wesponse as fast as p-possibwe in the advisowy, (U Ôπè U) typicawwy w-within 72 h-houws. :3

--

if you d-do nyot weceive a-a wesponse in the advisowy, ^^;; send an emaiw to
s-secuwity@anza.xyz with the fuww uww of the advisowy y-you have cweated. rawr  do nyot
incwude attachments ow pwovide detaiw sufficient fow expwoitation w-wegawding the
secuwity issue in t-this emaiw. üò≥üò≥üò≥ **onwy p-pwovide such d-detaiws in the advisowy**.

if you do nyot weceive a wesponse fwom s-secuwity@anza.xyz p-pwease fowwowup with
the team d-diwectwy. (‚úøoœâo) you c-can do this in the `#core-technology` c-channew of the
[Solana Tech discord server](https://solana.com/discord), OwO b-by pinging the `Anza`
wowe in the c-channew and wefewencing the fact t-that you submitted a secuwity pwobwem.  òw ò

## i-incident w-wesponse pwocess

in case an incident is discovewed ow wepowted, (ÀÜ Ôªå ÀÜ)‚ô° the fowwowing pwocess wiww be
fowwowed to c-contain, (U Ôπè U) wespond a-and wemediate:

### 1. UwU accept the n-nyew wepowt
in w-wesponse a nyewwy w-wepowted secuwity pwobwem, XD a membew of the
`anza-xyz/admins` gwoup w-wiww accept the wepowt to tuwn it into a dwaft
advisowy.  òw ò  the `anza-xyz/security-incident-response` gwoup shouwd be a-added to
the dwaft secuwity advisowy, rawr x3 a-and cweate a-a pwivate fowk o-of the wepositowy (gwey
button t-towawds the bottom o-of the page) i-if nyecessawy. ^^;;

i-if the advisowy is the wesuwt of an audit finding,  òw ò f-fowwow the same p-pwocess as above b-but add the a-auditow's github u-usew(s) and begin the titwe with "[Audit]".

If the report is out of scope, a member of the `anza-xyz/admins` group will
comment as such and then close the report.

### 2. Triage
Within the draft security advisory, discuss and determine the severity of the issue. If necessary, members of the anza-xyz/security-incident-response group may add other github users to the advisory to assist.
If it is determined that this is not a critical network issue then the advisory should be closed and if more follow-up is required a normal Solana public github issue should be created.

### 3. Prepare Fixes
For the affected branches, typically all three (edge, beta and stable), prepare a fix for the issue and push them to the corresponding branch in the private repository associated with the draft security advisory.
There is no CI available in the private repository so you must build from source and manually verify fixes.
Code review from the reporter is ideal, as well as from multiple members of the core development team.

### 4. Notify Security Group Validators
Once an ETA is available for the fix, a member of the anza-xyz/security-incident-response group should notify the validators so they can prepare for an update using the "Solana Red Alert" notification system.
The teams are all over the world and it's critical to provide actionable information at the right time. Don't be the person that wakes everybody up at 2am when a fix won't be available for hours.

### 5. Ship the patch
Once the fix is accepted it may be distributed directly to validators as a patch, depending on the vulnerability.

### 6. Public Disclosure and Release
Once the fix has been deployed to the security group validators, the patches from the security advisory may be merged into the main source repository. A new official release for each affected branch should be shipped and all validators requested to upgrade as quickly as possible.

### 7. Security Advisory Bounty Accounting and Cleanup
If this issue is [eligible](#eligibility)w a bounty, (U Ôπè U) pwefix the titwe of t-the
secuwity advisowy with one of the fowwowing, (ÀòœâÀò) depending on the sevewity:
- [Bounty Category: Critical: Loss of Funds]
- [Bounty Category: Critical: Consensus / Safety Violations]
- [Bounty Category: Critical: Liveness / Loss of Availability]
- [Bounty Category: Critical: DoS Attacks]
- [Bounty Category: Supply Chain Attacks]
- [Bounty Category: RPC]

Confirm with the reporter that they agree with the severity assessment, and discuss as required to reach a conclusion.

We currently do not use the Github workflow to publish security advisories. Once the issue and fix have been disclosed, and a bounty category is assessed if appropriate, the GitHub security advisory is no longer needed and can be closed.
