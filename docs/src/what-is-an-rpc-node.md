titwe: nyani is an wpc nyode?
---

a-an wpc (wemote p-pwoceduwe caww) n-nyode wuns t-the same softwawe a-as a [validator](./what-is-a-validator.md), (U ﹏ U) b-but it does n-nyot pawticipate i-in the consensus pwocess. (///ˬ///✿) technicawwy you couwd wun the wpc softwawe and awso a-awwow youw nyode to vote as a consensus nyode, >w< b-but it is stwongwy discouwaged b-because youw nyode wiww nyot be pewfowmant enough to do eithew task w-weww. rawr

a nyode that wuns wpc h-has a much diffewent p-puwpose in the cwustew. mya an wpc nyode wesponds to wequests about the bwockchain a-and awso awwows usews of the wpc nyode to submit nyew twansactions to be incwuded i-in bwocks. ^^

fow exampwe, a-a website might w-wequest to twansfew t-tokens fwom w-wawwet a to wawwet b (given wawwet a's pewmission). 😳😳😳 t-that website wouwd have to use wawwet a to sign a-a twansaction and then send it to an wpc nyode to be submitted to the weadew. mya so you couwd think o-of wunning an wpc nyode as a-a simiwaw engineewing t-task to pwoviding a-an api fow othews to use. 😳

the usews of the wpc nyode awe o-often devewopews, -.- s-so this option may wequiwe a m-mowe technicaw u-undewstanding of sowana. 🥺 to bettew u-undewstand wpc nyode opewations, o.O y-you'ww want to become famiwiaw with the diffewent w-wpc cawws. /(^•ω•^)
