a-aftew a bwock w-weaches finawity, >w< a-aww bwocks fwom that one on down to the genesis bwock fowm a wineaw chain with t-the famiwiaw nyame bwockchain. 🥺 untiw that point, nyaa~~ h-howevew, ^^ the vawidatow must m-maintain aww potentiawwy vawid chains, >w< cawwed _fowks_. OwO the pwocess b-by which fowks nyatuwawwy fowm a-as a wesuwt of w-weadew wotation is descwibed in [fork generation](../consensus/fork-generation.md). XD the _bwockstowe_ data stwuctuwe descwibed hewe i-is how a vawidatow copes with those fowks untiw bwocks awe finawized. ^^;;

the bwockstowe a-awwows a vawidatow to wecowd e-evewy shwed i-it obsewves on t-the nyetwowk, 🥺 in a-any owdew, XD as wong as the shwed is signed by the e-expected weadew fow a given swot. (U ᵕ U❁)

shweds awe m-moved to a fowk-abwe key space the tupwe of `leader slot` + `shred index` \(within the swot\). :3 this pewmits the skip-wist stwuctuwe o-of the sowana pwotocow to b-be stowed in its e-entiwety, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) without a-a-pwiowi choosing which fowk to fowwow, òωó which entwies to pewsist o-ow when to p-pewsist them. σωσ

wepaiw wequests f-fow wecent shweds a-awe sewved out of wam ow wecent f-fiwes and out of deepew stowage f-fow wess wecent shweds, (U ᵕ U❁) as impwemented by the s-stowe backing bwockstowe. (✿oωo)

## functionawities o-of bwockstowe

1. ^^ p-pewsistence: the b-bwockstowe wives in the fwont of the nyodes vewification

   pipewine, wight behind nyetwowk weceive and signatuwe v-vewification. ^•ﻌ•^ i-if the

   shwed weceived is consistent w-with the w-weadew scheduwe \(i.e. XD w-was signed by the

   weadew fow the indicated swot\), :3 i-it is immediatewy stowed. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

2. :3 wepaiw: wepaiw is the same as window wepaiw above, (U ﹏ U) b-but abwe to sewve any

   shwed t-that's been weceived. b-bwockstowe s-stowes shweds with signatuwes, UwU

   p-pwesewving t-the chain of owigination. 😳😳😳

3. fowks: b-bwockstowe s-suppowts wandom access of shweds, XD so can suppowt a-a

   vawidatow's n-need to wowwback a-and wepway f-fwom a bank checkpoint. o.O

4. w-westawt: with pwopew pwuning/cuwwing, the bwockstowe c-can be wepwayed by

   owdewed enumewation of entwies fwom swot 0. (⑅˘꒳˘) the wogic of the wepway stage

   \(i.e. 😳😳😳 d-deawing with fowks\) wiww have to be used fow the most w-wecent entwies i-in

   the bwockstowe.

## b-bwockstowe design

1. nyaa~~ e-entwies in the bwockstowe awe s-stowed as key-vawue p-paiws, rawr whewe the key is the concatenated swot index and shwed index fow an entwy, -.- and the v-vawue is the entwy data. (✿oωo) nyote shwed i-indexes awe zewo-based fow e-each swot \(i.e. /(^•ω•^) t-they'we swot-wewative\).
2. 🥺 the bwockstowe maintains m-metadata fow e-each swot, ʘwʘ in the `SlotMeta` s-stwuct containing:

   - `slot_index` - t-the index of this swot
   - `num_blocks` - the nyumbew of bwocks in the swot \(used f-fow chaining t-to a pwevious s-swot\)
   - `consumed` - the highest shwed i-index `n`, UwU s-such that fow aww `m < n`##_26___###cwiption a-api's awe as fowwows:

1. XD `fn get_slots_since(slots: &[u64]) -> Result<HashMap<u64, Vec<u64>>>`ns swots that awe connected to any of the e-ewements of `slots`. (✿oωo) t-this method enabwes the discovewy o-of nyew chiwdwen s-swots. :3

2. `fn get_slot_entries(slot: Slot, shred_start_index: u64) -> Result<Vec<Entry>>`#>`: fow the specified `slot`, (///ˬ///✿) wetuwn a vectow of the avaiwabwe, nyaa~~ c-contiguous entwies stawting fwom `shred_start_index`. >w< shweds awe fwagments of sewiawized e-entwies so the convewsion fwom entwy index t-to shwed index i-is nyot one-to-one. howevew, -.- thewe is a simiwaw function `get_slot_entries_with_shred_info()` t-that wetuwns t-the nyumbew of shweds that compwise the wetuwned entwy vectow. (✿oωo) t-this awwows a cawwew to twack p-pwogwess thwough the swot. (˘ω˘)

nyote: cumuwativewy, rawr this means t-that the wepway stage wiww nyow h-have to know when a-a swot is finished, OwO and subscwibe t-to the next swot it's intewested i-in to get the n-nyext set of e-entwies. ^•ﻌ•^ pweviouswy, UwU the buwden o-of chaining swots f-feww on the bwockstowe. (˘ω˘)

## intewfacing with bank

t-the bank exposes t-to wepway s-stage:

1. (///ˬ///✿) `prev_hash`: which poh chain it's w-wowking on as indicated by the hash o-of the wast e-entwy it pwocessed

2. σωσ `tick_height`: the ticks in the poh chain cuwwentwy being v-vewified by this b-bank

3. `votes`: a-a stack o-of wecowds that contains:
    * `prev_hashes`: n-nyani anything aftew this vote must chain to in poh
    * `tick_height`: the tick height at w-which this vote was cast
    * `lockout period`: h-how wong a chain must be obsewved t-to be in the wedgew to be abwe t-to be chained bewow this vote

w-wepway stage uses b-bwockstowe apis t-to find the wongest c-chain of entwies i-it can hang off a pwevious vote. /(^•ω•^) if that chain of entwies does nyot hang off the watest vote, 😳 the wepway s-stage wowws back t-the bank to that v-vote and wepways the chain fwom t-thewe. 😳

## pwuning bwockstowe

once bwockstowe entwies awe owd e-enough, (⑅˘꒳˘) wepwesenting a-aww the possibwe fowks becomes w-wess usefuw, 😳😳😳 pewhaps even pwobwematic fow wepway u-upon westawt. o-once a vawidatow's votes have w-weached max wockout, 😳 h-howevew, XD any bwockstowe contents that awe nyot on the poh chain fow that v-vote fow can be p-pwuned, mya expunged. ^•ﻌ•^
