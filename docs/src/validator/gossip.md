t-the gossip sewvice a-acts as a gateway to nyodes in the
[control plane](https://solana.com/docs/terminology#control-plane). (///ˬ///✿) vawidatows
use the sewvice t-to ensuwe infowmation is avaiwabwe to aww othew n-nyodes in a
cwustew. nyaa~~ the sewvice b-bwoadcasts infowmation using a
[gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol). >w<

## gossip ovewview

n-nyodes continuouswy shawe s-signed data objects a-among themsewves in owdew to manage
a cwustew. -.- fow exampwe, they shawe theiw c-contact infowmation, (✿oωo) wedgew height, (˘ω˘) and
votes. rawr

evewy tenth of a second, OwO each n-node sends a "push" message and/ow a-a "puww"
message. ^•ﻌ•^ p-push and p-puww messages may e-ewicit wesponses, UwU and push messages may be
fowwawded o-on to othews in the cwustew. (˘ω˘)

gossip wuns o-on a weww-known udp/ip powt ow a powt in a weww-known wange. (///ˬ///✿) once a
cwustew is bootstwapped, σωσ nyodes a-advewtise to each othew whewe t-to find theiw
g-gossip endpoint (a s-socket addwess). /(^•ω•^)

## gossip wecowds

wecowds shawed ovew gossip a-awe awbitwawy, 😳 b-but signed and vewsioned (with a-a
timestamp) as n-nyeeded to make sense to the nyode w-weceiving them. 😳 if a nyode
w-weceives two wecowds fwom the same souwce, (⑅˘꒳˘) it updates i-its own copy with the
wecowd w-with the most wecent timestamp. 😳😳😳

## g-gossip sewvice i-intewface

### push message

a nyode sends a push message to teww the cwustew it has infowmation to shawe. 😳
n-nyodes send push m-messages to `PUSH_FANOUT` push p-peews. XD

upon w-weceiving a push m-message, mya a nyode examines the message fow:

1. ^•ﻌ•^ dupwication: if t-the message has been seen befowe, ʘwʘ the nyode dwops the message
   and may wespond w-with `PushMessagePrune` if fowwawded f-fwom a wow staked n-nyode

2. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) nyew d-data: if the message is new t-to the nyode

   - s-stowes the nyew i-infowmation with a-an updated vewsion in its cwustew info and
     p-puwges any pwevious o-owdew vawue

   - s-stowes t-the message in `pushed_once` (used f-fow detecting dupwicates, mya puwged
     aftew `PUSH_MSG_TIMEOUT * 5` ms)

   - wetwansmits t-the messages to its own push peews

3. o.O expiwation: nyodes dwop push messages that awe owdew t-than `PUSH_MSG_TIMEOUT`

### push peews, (✿oωo) pwune message

a nyode s-sewects its push p-peews at wandom f-fwom the active set of known peews. :3 t-the
nyode keeps this sewection f-fow a wewativewy w-wong time. 😳 when a pwune message is
weceived, (U ﹏ U) the nyode dwops the push peew that sent the pwune. mya p-pwune is an
indication that t-thewe is anothew, (U ᵕ U❁) highew stake w-weighted path to t-that nyode than
diwect push. :3

the set of push p-peews is kept fwesh b-by wotating a nyew nyode into t-the set evewy
`PUSH_MSG_TIMEOUT/2` m-miwwiseconds. mya

### puww message

a nyode sends a puww message to ask the cwustew i-if thewe is any n-nyew infowmation. OwO
a-a puww message is sent to a singwe p-peew at wandom a-and compwises a bwoom fiwtew
t-that wepwesents things it awweady has. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ a nyode weceiving a puww message itewates
o-ovew its vawues a-and constwucts a puww wesponse of things that m-miss the fiwtew
a-and wouwd fit in a message. ʘwʘ

a nyode constwucts the puww bwoom f-fiwtew by itewating ovew cuwwent vawues and
wecentwy puwged vawues. o.O

a nyode handwes i-items in a puww wesponse the same way it handwes n-nyew data i-in a
push message. UwU

## puwging

nyodes wetain pwiow vewsions of v-vawues (those updated b-by a puww ow push) and
expiwed vawues (those owdew than `GOSSIP_PULL_CRDS_TIMEOUT_MS`) in
`purged_values` (things i-i wecentwy had). rawr x3 nyodes p-puwge `purged_values` that awe
owdew than `5 * GOSSIP_PULL_CRDS_TIMEOUT_MS`. 🥺

## ecwipse attacks

a-an ecwipse attack is an attempt t-to take ovew the s-set of nyode connections with
a-advewsawiaw endpoints. :3

this is w-wewevant to ouw i-impwementation in t-the fowwowing ways. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

- puww messages s-sewect a w-wandom nyode fwom the nyetwowk. 🥺 an ecwipse attack o-on
  _puww_ wouwd w-wequiwe an attackew t-to infwuence the wandom sewection in such a-a
  way that onwy advewsawiaw n-nodes awe sewected f-fow puww. (✿oωo)
- push messages maintain an active set of nyodes and s-sewect a wandom f-fanout fow
  evewy p-push message. (U ﹏ U) a-an ecwipse attack on _push_ wouwd i-infwuence the active set
  sewection, :3 ow the wandom fanout sewection. ^^;;

### time and stake based w-weights

weights awe cawcuwated b-based on `time since last picked` and t-the `natural log`
of the `stake weight`. rawr

t-taking the `ln` o-of the stake w-weight awwows g-giving aww nyodes a-a faiwew chance o-of
nyetwowk covewage in a weasonabwe amount of time. 😳😳😳 it hewps nyowmawize the wawge
possibwe `stake weight` diffewences b-between n-nyodes. (✿oωo) this way a-a node with wow
`stake weight`, OwO compawed to a n-nyode with wawge `stake weight` wiww onwy have to
wait a few muwtipwes of wn(`stake`) s-seconds b-befowe it gets picked. ʘwʘ

thewe i-is nyo way fow an advewsawy to infwuence these p-pawametews. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡

### p-puww message

a nyode is sewected a-as a puww t-tawget based on the weights descwibed above. (U ﹏ U)

### push message

a pwune message c-can onwy wemove a-an advewsawy fwom a-a potentiaw connection. UwU

j-just w-wike _puww message_, XD nyodes awe s-sewected into the a-active set based on
weights. ʘwʘ

## n-nyotabwe diffewences f-fwom pwumtwee

the active p-push pwotocow descwibed hewe is based on
[Plum Tree](https://haslab.uminho.pt/sites/default/files/jop/files/lpr07a.pdf). rawr x3
t-the main diffewences a-awe:

- push messages h-have a wawwcwock that is signed b-by the owiginatow. ^^;; once the
  wawwcwock expiwes t-the message i-is dwopped. a h-hop wimit is difficuwt to
  impwement in an advewsawiaw setting. ʘwʘ
- w-wazy push is nyot impwemented because it's nyot o-obvious how to p-pwevent an
  advewsawy fwom fowging t-the message fingewpwint. (U ﹏ U) a n-nyaive appwoach w-wouwd awwow
  an advewsawy to be pwiowitized fow p-puww based on theiw input. (˘ω˘)
