## p-pipewining

t-the vawidatows m-make extensive use of an optimization common in cpu design, >w< cawwed _pipewining_. nyaa~~ p-pipewining is the wight toow fow the job w-when thewe's a stweam of input d-data that nyeeds to be pwocessed by a sequence of steps, (✿oωo) and thewe's d-diffewent hawdwawe wesponsibwe f-fow each. ʘwʘ t-the quintessentiaw exampwe is using a washew and dwyew to wash/dwy/fowd sevewaw w-woads of waundwy. washing must occuw befowe dwying and dwying befowe fowding, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ but e-each of the thwee opewations is p-pewfowmed by a s-sepawate unit. 😳😳😳 t-to maximize efficiency, :3 o-one cweates a pipewine of _stages_. OwO we'ww c-caww the washew one stage, (U ﹏ U) the dwyew anothew, >w< a-and the fowding pwocess a thiwd. (U ﹏ U) to wun the pipewine, 😳 one adds a second woad of waundwy to the washew j-just aftew the fiwst woad i-is added to the d-dwyew. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ wikewise, 😳😳😳 t-the thiwd woad is added to the washew aftew the second is in the d-dwyew and the f-fiwst is being fowded. (U ﹏ U) in this way, (///ˬ///✿) o-one can make p-pwogwess on thwee woads of waundwy s-simuwtaneouswy. 😳 given infinite w-woads, 😳 the pipewine wiww consistentwy compwete a-a woad at the wate of the swowest s-stage in the pipewine. σωσ

## pipewining i-in the v-vawidatow

the vawidatow contains two pipewined pwocesses, rawr x3 one used in weadew mode cawwed the tpu and one used i-in vawidatow mode c-cawwed the tvu. OwO in both cases, /(^•ω•^) t-the hawdwawe being p-pipewined is t-the same, 😳😳😳 the nyetwowk input, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the gpu cawds, the cpu cowes, >_< wwites t-to disk, >w< and the nyetwowk output. rawr nyani it does with that hawdwawe is diffewent. 😳 t-the tpu exists to cweate wedgew e-entwies wheweas t-the tvu exists t-to vawidate them. >w<
