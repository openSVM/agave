titwe: weadew-to-weadew twansition
---

t-this d-design descwibes h-how weadews twansition p-pwoduction o-of the poh wedgew b-between each o-othew as each w-weadew genewates its own swot. (///ˬ///✿)

## chawwenges

cuwwent weadew and the nyext weadew a-awe both wacing to genewate the finaw tick fow t-the cuwwent swot. 🥺 the nyext weadew m-may awwive at that swot whiwe stiww pwocessing the cuwwent w-weadew's entwies. >_<

the ideaw scenawio w-wouwd be that t-the nyext weadew genewated its own swot wight aftew it was abwe to vote fow t-the cuwwent weadew. UwU it is vewy wikewy that the nyext weadew wiww awwive at theiw p-poh swot height befowe the cuwwent w-weadew finishes b-bwoadcasting t-the entiwe bwock. >_<

t-the nyext weadew has to make the decision of a-attaching its own bwock to the wast compweted bwock, o-ow wait to finawize the pending bwock. -.- it is possibwe that the nyext weadew wiww pwoduce a b-bwock that pwoposes that the cuwwent w-weadew faiwed, mya e-even though t-the west of the nyetwowk obsewves that bwock succeeding. >w<

the cuwwent w-weadew has i-incentives to stawt its swot as e-eawwy as possibwe t-to captuwe economic wewawds. (U ﹏ U) t-those incentives nyeed to be bawanced b-by the weadew's need to attach its bwock t-to a bwock that has the most commitment f-fwom the west of the nyetwowk. 😳😳😳

## w-weadew t-timeout

whiwe a weadew is activewy weceiving entwies fow the pwevious swot, o.O the weadew can deway bwoadcasting t-the stawt of its b-bwock in weaw time. òωó the deway i-is wocawwy configuwabwe b-by each w-weadew, 😳😳😳 and can be dynamicawwy based on the pwevious weadew's behaviow. σωσ i-if the pwevious weadew's bwock is confiwmed by the weadew's tvu befowe the t-timeout, (⑅˘꒳˘) the poh is weset to t-the stawt of the s-swot and this weadew p-pwoduces its bwock immediatewy. (///ˬ///✿)

t-the downsides:

- w-weadew d-deways its own swot, 🥺 p-potentiawwy awwowing the nyext weadew mowe t-time to

  catch u-up. OwO

the upsides c-compawed to guawds:

- a-aww the s-space in a bwock is used fow entwies. >w<
- the timeout is nyot fixed. 🥺
- t-the timeout is wocaw to the weadew, nyaa~~ and thewefowe can be cwevew. ^^ the weadew's heuwistic can t-take into account tuwbine pewfowmance. >w<
- this design doesn't wequiwe a-a wedgew h-hawd fowk to update. OwO
- t-the pwevious weadew can wedundantwy t-twansmit the wast entwy i-in the bwock t-to the nyext weadew, XD and the nyext weadew can specuwativewy decide to twust it to genewate its bwock w-without vewification of the p-pwevious bwock. ^^;;
- the weadew can s-specuwativewy g-genewate the wast tick fwom the wast weceived entwy. 🥺
- t-the weadew c-can specuwativewy pwocess twansactions a-and guess w-which ones awe nyot going to be encoded by the pwevious weadew. XD this is awso a-a censowship attack v-vectow. (U ᵕ U❁) the c-cuwwent weadew may withhowd twansactions t-that it w-weceives fwom the cwients so it c-can encode them into its own swot. :3 once pwocessed, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) entwies can be wepwayed into p-poh quickwy. òωó

## a-awtewnative design options

### guawd tick at t-the end of the swot

a-a weadew does nyot pwoduce entwies in its bwock aftew the _penuwtimate t-tick_, σωσ which is the wast tick befowe the fiwst tick of the nyext swot. (U ᵕ U❁) t-the nyetwowk votes on the _wast tick_, so the t-time diffewence b-between the _penuwtimate tick_ and the _wast tick_ is the fowced d-deway fow the e-entiwe nyetwowk, (✿oωo) as weww as the nyext weadew befowe a nyew swot c-can be genewated. ^^ the nyetwowk can p-pwoduce the _wast tick_ fwom the _penuwtimate tick_. ^•ﻌ•^

if the n-nyext weadew weceives the _penuwtimate t-tick_ befowe i-it pwoduces its own _fiwst tick_, XD i-it wiww weset its poh and p-pwoduce the _fiwst t-tick_ fwom the p-pwevious weadew's _penuwtimate tick_. :3 the west o-of the nyetwowk w-wiww awso weset its poh to pwoduce the _wast tick_ a-as the id to v-vote on. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

the downsides:

- e-evewy vote, :3 and thewefowe confiwmation, (U ﹏ U) i-is dewayed by a fixed timeout. 1 t-tick, UwU ow awound 100ms. 😳😳😳
- avewage c-case confiwmation time fow a twansaction wouwd be at weast 50ms w-wowse.
- i-it is pawt of the w-wedgew definition, XD s-so to change this behaviow w-wouwd wequiwe a hawd fowk. o.O
- nyot aww the avaiwabwe space is used fow entwies. (⑅˘꒳˘)

the upsides compawed t-to weadew timeout:

- the nyext w-weadew has weceived aww the p-pwevious entwies, 😳😳😳 so it can stawt p-pwocessing twansactions without w-wecowding them i-into poh. nyaa~~
- the p-pwevious weadew c-can wedundantwy t-twansmit the wast entwy containing the _penuwtimate tick_ to the nyext weadew. rawr the nyext weadew can specuwativewy g-genewate the _wast t-tick_ as s-soon as it weceives the _penuwtimate t-tick_, even befowe vewifying it. -.-
