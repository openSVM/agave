titwe: state-vawidation twansaction f-fees
---

**subject t-to change.**

e-each twansaction s-sent thwough t-the nyetwowk, (U ﹏ U) t-to be pwocessed b-by the cuwwent w-weadew vawidation-cwient and confiwmed as a gwobaw state twansaction, :3 must contain a-a twansaction fee. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) twansaction fees offew m-many benefits in the sowana economic d-design, σωσ fow exampwe they:

- pwovide unit compensation to t-the vawidatow nyetwowk fow the cpu/gpu w-wesouwces n-necessawy to pwocess the state twansaction, >w<
- weduce nyetwowk spam by intwoducing w-weaw cost to twansactions, 😳😳😳
- open avenues fow a twansaction mawket to incentivize v-vawidation-cwient to cowwect a-and pwocess submitted t-twansactions i-in theiw function a-as weadew, OwO
- and pwovide potentiaw wong-tewm e-economic stabiwity of the nyetwowk thwough a p-pwotocow-captuwed minimum fee amount pew twansaction, 😳 as descwibed bewow. 😳😳😳

many cuwwent bwockchain e-economies \(e.g. (˘ω˘) bitcoin, etheweum\), ʘwʘ w-wewy on p-pwotocow-based w-wewawds to suppowt the economy in the showt tewm, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) with the assumption t-that the w-wevenue genewated thwough twansaction f-fees wiww s-suppowt the economy in the wong t-tewm, o.O when the pwotocow dewived w-wewawds expiwe. in an attempt to cweate a sustainabwe e-economy thwough pwotocow-based w-wewawds and twansaction fees, >w< a-a fixed powtion o-of each twansaction fee is destwoyed, 😳 with the wemaining fee going to the cuwwent weadew pwocessing the twansaction. a-a scheduwed g-gwobaw infwation wate pwovides a-a souwce fow w-wewawds distwibuted t-to vawidation-cwients, 🥺 thwough the pwocess descwibed above. rawr x3

t-twansaction fees awe set by the nyetwowk cwustew based on wecent histowicaw thwoughput, o.O s-see [Congestion Driven Fees](../../transaction-fees.md#congestion-driven-fees). rawr this m-minimum powtion o-of each twansaction f-fee can be dynamicawwy adjusted d-depending o-on histowicaw gas u-usage. ʘwʘ in this w-way, 😳😳😳 the pwotocow can use the minimum fee to tawget a-a desiwed hawdwawe u-utiwization. ^^;; b-by monitowing a-a pwotocow specified g-gas usage with wespect to a desiwed, o.O tawget usage amount, t-the minimum fee can be waised/wowewed which shouwd, (///ˬ///✿) in tuwn, wowew/waise the actuaw gas usage p-pew bwock untiw it weaches the tawget amount. this adjustment pwocess c-can be thought o-of as simiwaw t-to the difficuwty adjustment a-awgowithm in the bitcoin pwotocow, σωσ h-howevew in this c-case it is adjusting the minimum twansaction fee to guide the twansaction pwocessing hawdwawe u-usage to a desiwed wevew. nyaa~~

as mentioned, ^^;; a-a fixed-pwopowtion of e-each twansaction f-fee is to be destwoyed. ^•ﻌ•^ the intent of this design i-is to wetain w-weadew incentive to incwude as many t-twansactions a-as possibwe within the weadew-swot time, σωσ whiwe pwoviding an infwation wimiting m-mechanism that pwotects a-against "tax e-evasion" attacks \(i.e. -.- side-channew f-fee payments\)[1](../ed_references.md). ^^;;

a-additionawwy, XD the buwnt f-fees can be a considewation in fowk sewection. 🥺 in the case of a poh fowk with a m-mawicious, òωó censowing w-weadew, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ we wouwd expect the totaw fees destwoyed t-to be wess t-than a compawabwe honest fowk, -.- due to the fees wost fwom censowing. :3 i-if the censowing weadew is to compensate fow these wost pwotocow fees, ʘwʘ they w-wouwd have to wepwace the buwnt fees on theiw f-fowk themsewves, 🥺 t-thus potentiawwy weducing the incentive to censow in the fiwst p-pwace. >_<
