e-each twansaction t-that is submitted t-to the s-sowana wedgew imposes c-costs. :3 twansaction f-fees paid b-by the submittew, 😳😳😳 a-and cowwected by a vawidatow, (˘ω˘) in theowy, account fow the akawaii~, ^^ twansactionaw, :3 c-costs of vawidating and adding that data t-to the wedgew. -.- unaccounted in this p-pwocess is the mid-tewm stowage of active wedgew state, 😳 nyecessawiwy m-maintained by the wotating v-vawidatow set. mya t-this type of stowage imposes costs nyot onwy to vawidatows but awso to the bwoadew n-nyetwowk as active state gwows so does data twansmission and vawidation ovewhead. (˘ω˘) t-to account fow these costs, >_< w-we descwibe hewe o-ouw pwewiminawy d-design and impwementation o-of stowage went. -.-

stowage went can b-be paid via one of two methods:

method 1: set i-it and fowget it

with this appwoach, 🥺 accounts with two-yeaws wowth of went deposits secuwed awe e-exempt fwom nyetwowk went chawges. (U ﹏ U) b-by maintaining t-this minimum-bawance, >w< t-the bwoadew nyetwowk benefits fwom weduced wiquidity and t-the account howdew c-can west assuwed that theiw `Account::data` w-wiww be wetained f-fow continuaw access/usage. mya

method 2: p-pay pew byte

if an account h-has wess than two-yeaws wowth of deposited went t-the nyetwowk chawges went on a-a pew-epoch basis, >w< in cwedit fow t-the nyext epoch. nyaa~~ t-this went is deducted at a wate specified in genesis, (✿oωo) in wampowts pew kiwobyte-yeaw.
