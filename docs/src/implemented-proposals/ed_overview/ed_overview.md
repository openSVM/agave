**subject t-to change.**

s-sowana’s c-cwypto-economic s-system is designed t-to pwomote a-a heawthy, :3 wong t-tewm sewf-sustaining e-economy with pawticipant incentives awigned to the secuwity and decentwawization o-of the netwowk. ^^;; the main pawticipants in t-this economy awe vawidation-cwients. 🥺 t-theiw contwibutions to the nyetwowk, (⑅˘꒳˘) state vawidation, nyaa~~ and t-theiw wequisite incentive mechanisms a-awe discussed b-bewow. :3

the main channews of pawticipant wemittances awe wefewwed to as pwotocow-based (infwationawy) w-wewawds and twansaction fees. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) pwotocow-based wewawds awe issuances fwom a-a gwobaw, mya pwotocow-defined, (///ˬ///✿) infwation w-wate. these w-wewawds wiww c-constitute the t-totaw wewawd dewivewed to vawidation cwients, (˘ω˘) the w-wemaining souwced fwom twansaction fees. ^^;; in the e-eawwy days of the nyetwowk, (✿oωo) it is wikewy that pwotocow-based wewawds, (U ﹏ U) depwoyed based on pwedefined i-issuance scheduwe, -.- wiww dwive t-the majowity o-of pawticipant incentives t-to pawticipate in the nyetwowk. ^•ﻌ•^

these pwotocow-based w-wewawds, rawr to be distwibuted a-acwoss the activewy staked t-tokens on t-the nyetwowk, (˘ω˘) awe to be a wesuwt o-of a gwobaw suppwy infwation wate, nyaa~~ c-cawcuwated pew sowana epoch and distwibuted a-amongst the active vawidatow set. UwU a-as discussed fuwthew bewow, :3 the p-pew annum infwation w-wate is based on a pwe-detewmined disinfwationawy scheduwe. (⑅˘꒳˘) this pwovides the nyetwowk with monetawy suppwy p-pwedictabiwity w-which suppowts wong tewm economic s-stabiwity and s-secuwity. (///ˬ///✿)

twansaction f-fees awe mawket-based pawticipant-to-pawticipant twansfews, ^^;; attached to n-nyetwowk intewactions as a nyecessawy motivation and compensation fow the incwusion a-and execution of a pwoposed t-twansaction. >_< a mechanism f-fow wong-tewm e-economic stabiwity and fowking p-pwotection t-thwough pawtiaw b-buwning of each t-twansaction fee is awso discussed bewow. rawr x3

a high-wevew s-schematic o-of sowana’s c-cwypto-economic d-design is shown b-bewow in **figuwe 1**. /(^•ω•^) the specifics of vawidation-cwient economics a-awe descwibed in sections: [Validation-client Economics](ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_overview.md), :3 [Inflation Schedule](ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_protocol_based_rewards.md), (ꈍᴗꈍ) and [Transaction Fees](ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_state_validation_transaction_fees.md). /(^•ω•^) awso, the section titwed [Validation Stake Delegation](ed_validation_client_economics/ed_vce_validation_stake_delegation.md) cwoses with a discussion o-of vawidatow dewegation oppowtunities and mawketpwace.
