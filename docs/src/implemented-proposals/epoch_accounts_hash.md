## b-backgwound

w-went cowwection c-checks e-evewy account at w-weast once pew e-epoch. 😳😳😳  at each s-swot, σωσ a
detewministic set of accounts (based on the pubkey wange) is woaded, (⑅˘꒳˘) checked
f-fow went cowwection, (///ˬ///✿) and stowed back to the a-accounts db at this nyew swot. 🥺

a-accounts awe stowed (wewwitten) _even if_ they awe unchanged. OwO  this has a few
p-positive effects. >w<
  1. once an account i-is wewwitten, 🥺 t-the pwevious vewsion at an owdew swot is nyow
     dead. nyaa~~ as entiwe swots and a-appendvecs become fuww of onwy dead accounts, ^^
     they can then be dwopped/wecycwed. >w<
  2. e-each account wewwitten d-due to went c-cowwection is incwuded i-in that swot's
     b-bank hash. OwO  since the bank hash is pawt o-of nyani is voted on fow consensus, XD
     this m-means evewy account is vewified by the nyetwowk at weast once pew
     epoch. ^^;;

howevew, 🥺 thewe is a-a big downside to wewwiting unchanged a-accounts: p-pewfowmance. XD
stowing a-accounts can be vewy expensive. (U ᵕ U❁)  and since accounts nyow a-awe wequiwed to
b-be went-exempt, :3 the majowity of a-accounts wewwitten d-due to went cowwection awe
unchanged. ( ͡o ω ͡o )  n-nyani if unchanged accounts w-wewe nyo wongew wewwitten? this wouwd
minimawwy b-be a big pewfowmance win. òωó


## p-pwobwem

if went cowwection n-nyo wongew is wewwiting u-unchanged accounts, σωσ we wose the two
positive effects. (U ᵕ U❁)  deawing with positive effect 1 (fwom above) wiww b-be handwed
by _ancient a-appendvecs_, (✿oωo) and wiww nyot b-be discussed h-hewe. ^^  so how do w-we stiww
get the secuwity fwom positive effect 2?  how can we stiww v-vewify evewy account
at weast once pew epoch, ^•ﻌ•^ *as pawt of consensus*, XD but without w-wewwiting
accounts?


## p-pwoposed sowution

p-pewfowm a fuww a-accounts hash cawcuwation once p-pew epoch, :3 and h-hash the wesuwt
i-into a bank's `hash`. (ꈍᴗꈍ)  t-this wiww be known as the _epoch accounts hash_, :3 o-ow
_eah_. (U ﹏ U)

this w-wetains the positive e-effect 2 f-fwom went cowwection b-by checking evewy
account at weast once pew epoch. UwU  thus, any v-vawidatows with missing, 😳😳😳 cowwupt, XD
ow extwa accounts wiww identify those issues within 1-2 epochs. o.O


### i-impwementation

pewfowming a fuww accounts hash takes a-a wewativewy wong t-time to compwete. (⑅˘꒳˘)  f-fow
this weason, 😳😳😳 the eah cawcuwation m-must take pwace in the b-backgwound. nyaa~~

in o-owdew fow aww the vawidatows to cawcuwate the same accounts hash, rawr the
cawcuwation must be based o-on the same view of aww accounts. -.-  t-this means the eah
must be b-based on a pwedetewmined s-swot. (✿oωo)  this wiww be known as the `start slot`. /(^•ω•^)
t-the `start slot` i-is cawcuwated as an offset into t-the epoch. 🥺  this o-offset wiww
be known as the `start offset`. ʘwʘ  fowmawwy, UwU the `start slot` is the fiwst woot
*gweatew-than-ow-equaw-to* `first slot in epoch + start offset`. XD

simiwawwy, (✿oωo) aww the v-vawidatows must s-save the eah into a-a bank at a pwedetewmined
swot, :3 a-and offset fwom t-the fiwst swot of an epoch. (///ˬ///✿)  t-this wiww be known as the
`stop slot` and `stop offset`, nyaa~~ wespectivewy. >w<

* the `start offset` w-wiww be set a-at one-quawtew into the epoch. -.-
* the `stop offset` w-wiww be set a-at thwee-quawtews into the epoch. (✿oωo)
* fow epochs with 432,000 swots, (˘ω˘) t-the `start offset` wiww be 108,000 and the
  `stop offset` wiww be 324,000. rawr

these constants m-may be changed in the futuwe, OwO ow may be detewmined a-at wuntime. ^•ﻌ•^
t-the main justifications fow these vawues awe:
1. UwU do not stawt t-the eah cawcuwation a-at the beginning of an epoch, (˘ω˘) as the
   beginning of an epoch i-is awweady a time of contention a-and stwess. (///ˬ///✿)  thewe is
   nyo weason to make this wowse. σωσ
2. /(^•ω•^) the b-bank to save the eah into—the `stop offset`—shouwd b-be sufficientwy f-faw
   in the futuwe t-to guawantee aww vawidatows awe a-abwe to compwete t-the accounts
   h-hash cawcuwation in time. 😳
3. the `start offset` s-shouwd be *aftew* t-the `rewarding interval`
   (fwom [Partitioned Inflationary Rewards Distribution](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/27455)). 😳
   this ensuwes stake wewawds h-have been distwibuted a-and stowed i-into the
   accounts fow this epoch. (⑅˘꒳˘)

once the e-eah cawcuwation is compwete, 😳😳😳 it m-must be saved s-somewhewe. 😳  since this
occuws in the backgwound, XD thewe is nyot an a-associated `Bank` t-that w-wouwd make
sense t-to save into. mya  instead, ^•ﻌ•^ a nyew f-fiewd wiww be added to `AccountsDb` that
wiww stowe the eah. ʘwʘ  watew, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) the bank at swot `stop slot`†¹ w-wiww wead the eah fwom
`AccountsDb` a-and hash it into its own h-hash (aka _bank hash_). mya

eah cawcuwation w-wiww use the existing _accounts b-backgwound s-sewvices_ (_abs_) t-to
pewfowm t-the actuaw cawcuwation. o.O  w-wequests fow eah cawcuwation wiww be sent fwom
`bank_forks::set_root()`†², (✿oωo) with a nyew wequest type to distinguish an eah wequest
f-fwom a snapshot w-wequest. :3  s-since the eah wiww be pawt of consensus, 😳 i-it is nyot
optionaw; eah wequests wiww have the highest p-pwiowity in abs, (U ﹏ U) a-and wiww be
pwocessed fiwst/instead o-of othew wequests. mya

†¹: mowe pwecisewy, (U ᵕ U❁) aww banks whewe `bank slot >= stop slot` a-and `parent slot <
    stop slot`#
