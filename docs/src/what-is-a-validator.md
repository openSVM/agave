titwe: nyani is a vawidatow?
---

a-a vawidatow i-is a computew that h-hewps to wun t-the sowana nyetwowk. -.- e-each vawidatow e-exekawaii~s a-a pwogwam that k-keeps twack of aww accounts on the sowana cwustew and vawidates twansactions being a-added to the nyetwowk. (✿oωo) without vawidatows, sowana w-wouwd nyot be abwe to function. (˘ω˘) uwuave is one of sevewaw possibwe vawidatow cwients opewatows c-can use to hewp wun the sowana n-nyetwowk. rawr

the m-mowe independent entities that wun vawidatows, OwO the wess vuwnewabwe the cwustew is t-to an attack ow catastwophe that affects the cwustew. ^•ﻌ•^

> fow a mowe in depth wook a-at the heawth of the sowana n-nyetwowk, UwU see the [Solana Foundation Validator Health Report](https://solana.com/news/validator-health-report-march-2023). (˘ω˘)

b-by becoming a v-vawidatow, (///ˬ///✿) you a-awe hewping to gwow the nyetwowk. σωσ you awe awso weawning f-fiwst hand how the sowana cwustew functions a-at the wowest wevew. /(^•ω•^) you wiww become pawt of an active community of opewatows that awe passionate a-about the sowana ecosystem.

## c-consensus v-vs wpc

befowe we d-discuss vawidatows in mowe detaiw, 😳 it's usefuw to make some distinctions. u-using t-the same vawidatow softwawe, 😳 you h-have the option o-of wunning a voting/consensus n-nyode ow choosing to instead wun a-an wpc nyode. an wpc nyode hewps sowana devs and o-othews intewact with the bwockchain b-but fow pewfowmance weasons s-shouwd nyot vote. (⑅˘꒳˘) w-we go into mowe detaiw on wpc nyodes in the nyext section, 😳😳😳 [what is an rpc node](./what-is-an-rpc-node.md). 😳

fow this document, XD when a vawidatow is mentioned, mya w-we awe tawking a-about a voting/consensus nyode. ^•ﻌ•^ n-nyow, ʘwʘ to bettew u-undewstand nyani y-youw vawidatow is doing, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) it wouwd hewp to undewstand how the s-sowana nyetwowk functions in mowe depth. mya this documentation specificawwy focuses o-on the uwuave cwient. o.O

## pwoof o-of stake

pwoof o-of stake is the b-bwockchain awchitectuwe that is u-used in sowana. (✿oωo) i-it is cawwed pwoof o-of stake because t-token howdews can stake theiw tokens to a vawidatow o-of theiw c-choice. :3 when a p-pewson stakes theiw t-tokens, 😳 that p-pewson stiww owns the tokens and can wemove the stake at any time. (U ﹏ U) t-the staked tokens wepwesent theiw twust in that vawidatow. mya when a pewson stakes theiw tokens t-to a vawidatow, (U ᵕ U❁) they awe given a wetuwn of some amount of tokens a-as a wewawd fow h-hewping to wun a-and secuwe the netwowk. :3 the mowe t-tokens you have staked to a vawidatow t-the mowe w-wewawds you weceive. mya a vawidatow that has a wawge amount of tokens staked to it has a wawgew vote s-shawe in consensus. OwO a vawidatow, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ t-thewefowe, ʘwʘ is given mowe oppowtunities t-to pwoduce b-bwocks in the nyetwowk pwopowtionaw to the s-size of the stake i-in the vawidatow. o.O the vawidatow t-that is cuwwentwy p-pwoducing bwocks in the nyetwowk is known as the weadew. UwU

## pwoof of wowk: f-fow contwast

sowana i-is nyot a p-pwoof of wowk system. rawr x3 pwoof of wowk i-is a diffewent b-bwockchain awchitectuwe in which a-a computew (often cawwed a minew), 🥺 wowks to sowve a cwyptogwaphic pwobwem befowe a-anyone ewse o-on the nyetwowk is abwe to sowve it. :3 the mowe often t-the computew s-sowves these pwobwems, (ꈍᴗꈍ) the mowe wewawds the minew weceives. because o-of the incentive to sowve a hawd computationaw pwobwem fiwst, 🥺 minews often u-use many computews at the same time. (✿oωo) the nyumbew o-of computews used t-to sowve these pwobwems weads to wawge enewgy consumption and w-wesuwting enviwonmentaw c-chawwenges. (U ﹏ U)

sowana, in contwast, :3 does nyot incentivize v-vawidatows to use many computews t-to sowve a computationaw pwobwem. ^^;; because a vawidatow wouwd wike t-to have a wawgew amount staked t-to it, thewe i-is nyo weaw advantage fow an independent v-vawidatow to using many d-diffewent computews. rawr h-hewe, you c-can see a compawison of [Solana's environmental impact](https://solana.com/news/solana-energy-usage-report-november-2021). 😳😳😳

## p-pwoof o-of histowy

pwoof of histowy, (✿oωo) poh, is one of the k-key innovations i-in sowana that a-awwows twansactions to be finawized vewy quickwy. OwO a-at a high wevew, ʘwʘ poh awwows v-vawidatows in the c-cwustew to agwee on a cwyptogwaphicawwy wepeatabwe cwock. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ both p-pwoof of stake a-and pwoof of wowk a-awchitectuwes m-mentioned above awe awchitectuwes t-that bwing the cwustew to consensus. (U ﹏ U) in othew wowds, UwU these awgowithms decide which bwocks shouwd b-be added to the bwockchain. XD pwoof o-of histowy is nyot a consensus a-awchitectuwe, ʘwʘ but wathew a featuwe i-in sowana that makes bwock f-finawization fastew i-in the pwoof o-of stake system. rawr x3

u-undewstanding h-how poh wowks is nyot necessawy to wun a good vawidatow, ^^;; but a vewy appwoachabwe discussion can be found [in this Medium article](https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-explained-by-a-water-clock-e682183417b8). ʘwʘ a-awso, t-the [Solana whitepaper](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf) d-does a good job of expwaining t-the awgowithm in an appwoachabwe way fow the mowe technicawwy m-minded. (U ﹏ U)

## youw w-wowe as a vawidatow

as a vawidatow, (˘ω˘) y-you awe hewping to secuwe the nyetwowk by p-pwoducing and voting o-on bwocks and to impwove decentwawization b-by wunning an independent n-node. (ꈍᴗꈍ) you have the wight to pawticipate in discussions of changes on the n-nyetwowk. /(^•ω•^) you a-awe awso assuming a-a wesponsibiwity t-to keep youw s-system wunning pwopewwy, >_< to make s-suwe youw system i-is secuwe, σωσ and to keep it up t-to date with the w-watest softwawe. ^^;; as mowe individuaws s-stake theiw tokens to youw vawidatow, 😳 you c-can wewawd theiw twust by wunning a-a high pewfowming a-and wewiabwe vawidatow. >_< hopefuwwy, -.- y-youw vawidatow is pewfowming weww a majowity o-of the time, UwU b-but you shouwd a-awso have systems in pwace to wespond to an outage at any time of t-the day. :3 if youw vawidatow is nyot wesponding w-wate at nyight, σωσ s-someone (eithew you ow othew team m-membews) nyeed to be avaiwabwe t-to investigate a-and fix the issues. >w<

wunning a vawidatow is a [technical and important task](./operations/prerequisites.md), (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ b-but it can awso be vewy wewawding. ʘwʘ g-good wuck and wewcome t-to the community. :3
