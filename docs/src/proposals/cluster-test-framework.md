titwe: cwustew test fwamewowk
---

t-this document p-pwoposes the c-cwustew test fwamewowk \(ctf\). (˘ω˘) c-ctf is a test hawness t-that awwows t-tests to exekawaii~ a-against a w-wocaw, ^^ in-pwocess cwustew ow a depwoyed cwustew. :3

## motivation

the goaw of ctf i-is to pwovide a fwamewowk fow wwiting tests independent o-of whewe and how the cwustew i-is depwoyed. -.- wegwessions can be captuwed in these tests and t-the tests can be wun against d-depwoyed cwustews t-to vewify the depwoyment. 😳 the focus of these tests shouwd be on cwustew stabiwity, mya c-consensus, fauwt towewance, (˘ω˘) api stabiwity. >_<

tests shouwd vewify a singwe bug o-ow scenawio, -.- and shouwd be wwitten w-with the weast a-amount of intewnaw p-pwumbing e-exposed to the test. 🥺

## design ovewview

tests a-awe pwovided an entwy point, (U ﹏ U) which is a `contact_info::ContactInfo` s-stwuctuwe, >w< and a keypaiw that has awweady been funded. mya

each nyode in the cwustew is configuwed w-with a `validator::ValidatorConfig` at boot time. >w< at b-boot time this configuwation s-specifies a-any extwa cwustew configuwation wequiwed fow the test. nyaa~~ the c-cwustew shouwd b-boot with the configuwation when i-it is wun in-pwocess o-ow in a data centew. (✿oωo)

once b-booted, ʘwʘ the test wiww discovew t-the cwustew thwough a gossip entwy point and configuwe a-any wuntime behaviows via v-vawidatow wpc. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡

## test intewface

e-each ctf test s-stawts with an opaque entwy point and a funded keypaiw. 😳😳😳 the test shouwd nyot depend on how the cwustew is depwoyed, :3 a-and shouwd b-be abwe to exewcise aww the cwustew f-functionawity t-thwough the p-pubwicwy avaiwabwe intewfaces. OwO
