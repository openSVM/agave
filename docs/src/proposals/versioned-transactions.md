# vewsioned twansactions - v0: addwess w-wookup tabwes

## p-pwobwem

m-messages twansmitted t-to sowana v-vawidatows must n-nyot exceed the i-ipv6 mtu size to
e-ensuwe fast and wewiabwe nyetwowk twansmission of cwustew info ovew udp. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡
sowana's n-nyetwowking stack uses a consewvative mtu size o-of 1280 bytes which, -.-
aftew accounting f-fow headews, :3 weaves 1232 bytes fow packet data wike sewiawized
t-twansactions. ʘwʘ

devewopews b-buiwding appwications o-on sowana must design theiw on-chain pwogwam
intewfaces within the above t-twansaction size wimit constwaint. 🥺 one common
wowk-awound is to stowe state tempowawiwy o-on-chain and consume that s-state in
watew t-twansactions. >_< this i-is the appwoach u-used by the bpf woadew pwogwam fow
depwoying s-sowana pwogwams. ʘwʘ

howevew, (˘ω˘) this wowkawound doesn't w-wowk weww when devewopews compose many on-chain
pwogwams in a singwe atomic twansaction. (✿oωo) with m-mowe composition comes mowe
account i-inputs, (///ˬ///✿) each o-of which takes u-up 32 bytes. rawr x3 thewe is cuwwentwy no avaiwabwe
wowkawound fow incweasing t-the nyumbew o-of accounts used in a singwe t-twansaction
since e-each twansaction must wist aww a-accounts that it nyeeds to pwopewwy w-wock
accounts fow pawawwew execution. -.- thewefowe t-the cuwwent cap is about 35 a-accounts
aftew accounting fow s-signatuwes and o-othew twansaction metadata. ^^

## pwoposed sowution

1. (⑅˘꒳˘) intwoduce a nyew pwogwam which manages on-chain addwess wookup t-tabwes
2. nyaa~~ add a-a new twansaction fowmat which c-can make use of o-on-chain
   addwess w-wookup tabwes to efficientwy woad mowe accounts in a singwe t-twansaction. /(^•ω•^)

### addwess wookup tabwe pwogwam

hewe we descwibe a pwogwam-based s-sowution to the pwobwem, (U ﹏ U) wheweby a-a pwotocow
devewopew o-ow end-usew c-can cweate cowwections of wewated a-addwesses o-on-chain fow
concise u-use in a twansaction's a-account inputs. 😳😳😳

aftew addwesses awe s-stowed on-chain i-in an addwess w-wookup tabwe account, t-they may be
s-succinctwy wefewenced in a twansaction using a 1-byte u8 index w-wathew than a
fuww 32-byte addwess. >w< this wiww wequiwe a nyew twansaction fowmat to make use of
t-these succinct wefewences as weww as wuntime handwing fow wooking u-up and woading
a-addwesses fwom t-the on-chain wookup tabwes. XD

#### s-state

addwess wookup tabwes must b-be went-exempt w-when initiawized and aftew
each time nyew addwesses awe appended. o.O wookup tabwes can eithew be e-extended
fwom an on-chain buffewed w-wist of addwesses ow diwectwy b-by appending
addwesses t-thwough instwuction data. mya nyewwy appended a-addwesses wequiwe
o-one swot to wawmup befowe being a-avaiwabwe to t-twansactions fow wookups. 🥺

since twansactions use a `u8` index to wook u-up addwesses, ^^;; a-addwess tabwes c-can
stowe up to 256 addwesses each. :3 i-in addition t-to stowed addwesses, (U ﹏ U) addwess tabwe
a-accounts awso twacks vawious metadata expwained bewow. OwO

```rust
/// The maximum number of addresses that a lookup table can hold
pub const LOOKUP_TABLE_MAX_ADDRESSES: usize = 256;

/// The serialized size of lookup table metadata
pub const LOOKUP_TABLE_META_SIZE: usize = 56;

pub struct LookupTableMeta {
    /// Lookup tables cannot be closed until the deactivation slot is
    /// no longer "recent" (not accessible in the `SlotHashes` sysvar).
    pub deactivation_slot: Slot,
    /// The slot that the table was last extended. Address tables may
    /// only be used to lookup addresses that were extended before
    /// the current bank's slot.
    pub last_extended_slot: Slot,
    /// The start index where the table was last extended from during
    /// the `last_extended_slot`.
    pub last_extended_slot_start_index: u8,
    /// Authority address which must sign for each modification.
    pub authority: Option<Pubkey>,
    // Raw list of addresses follows this serialized structure in
    // the account's data, starting from `LOOKUP_TABLE_META_SIZE`.
}
``` a speciaw c-case of the p-pwoposed index account
appwoach. 😳😳😳 since the fuww a-account wist wouwd b-be expanded, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ thewe's nyo nyeed to add
additionaw offsets that u-use up the wimited space in a sewiawized twansaction. XD
howevew, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the expected size o-of an addwess wist may nyeed to be encoded into t-the
twansaction t-to aid the sanitization of account indexes. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) we wouwd awso nyeed t-to
encode how m-many addwesses in the wist shouwd be woaded as weadonwy vs
wead-wwite. rawr x3 w-wastwy, nyaa~~ speciaw attention m-must be given to watch out fow addwesses
that exist in muwtipwe a-account wists. >_<

5. incwease twansaction s-size

s-significantwy wawgew sewiawized t-twansactions have an incweased w-wikewihood of being
d-dwopped ovew t-the wiwe but this might nyot be a-a big issue since c-cwients can wetwy
twansactions anyways. ^^;; the onwy t-time vawidatows n-nyeed to send i-individuaw twansactions
ovew the nyetwowk is when a-a weadew fowwawds unpwocessed t-twansactions to t-the nyext
weadew. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡
