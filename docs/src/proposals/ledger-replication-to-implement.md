titwe: wedgew wepwication
---

n-nyote: this wedgew w-wepwication s-sowution was pawtiawwy i-impwemented, (˘ω˘) b-but nyot
compweted. òωó t-the pawtiaw i-impwementation w-was wemoved by
https://github.com/sowana-wabs/sowana/puww/9992 in owdew to pwevent the secuwity
wisk of unused c-code. UwU the fiwst pawt of this design document w-wefwects the
once-impwemented pawts o-of wedgew wepwication. ^•ﻌ•^ the
[second part of this document](#ledger-replication-not-implemented) descwibes the
pawts of the sowution n-nyevew impwemented. mya

## pwoof o-of wepwication

a-at fuww capacity on a 1gbps nyetwowk sowana wiww genewate 4 petabytes of data pew y-yeaw. (✿oωo) to pwevent the nyetwowk fwom centwawizing awound vawidatows that have to s-stowe the fuww data set this pwotocow p-pwoposes a-a way fow mining n-nyodes to pwovide s-stowage capacity fow pieces of the data. XD

the b-basic idea to pwoof of wepwication is encwypting a-a dataset with a pubwic symmetwic key using cbc encwyption, :3 then hash the encwypted dataset. (U ﹏ U) t-the main pwobwem with the nyaive a-appwoach is that a-a dishonest stowage n-node can stweam the encwyption and dewete the data as it's h-hashed. UwU the simpwe s-sowution is to pewiodicawwy w-wegenewate the hash b-based on a signed poh vawue. ʘwʘ t-this ensuwes that aww the data i-is pwesent duwing the genewation of the pwoof and i-it awso wequiwes vawidatows to h-have the entiwety of the encwypted d-data pwesent f-fow vewification of evewy pwoof of evewy identity. >w< so the space wequiwed to vawidate is `number_of_proofs * data_size`

## optimization w-with poh

o-ouw impwovement on this appwoach i-is to wandomwy s-sampwe the encwypted s-segments fastew than it takes to encwypt, 😳😳😳 and wecowd the h-hash of those sampwes into the poh wedgew. rawr thus the segments stay in the exact s-same owdew fow evewy powep and v-vewification can s-stweam the data a-and vewify aww the pwoofs in a s-singwe batch. ^•ﻌ•^ this w-way we can vewify m-muwtipwe pwoofs c-concuwwentwy, σωσ each one on its own cuda cowe. :3 t-the totaw space w-wequiwed fow vewification i-is `1_ledger_segment + 2_cbc_blocks * number_of_identities` with c-cowe count equaw t-to `number_of_identities`. rawr x3 we use a 64-byte chacha cbc bwock size. nyaa~~

## n-nyetwowk

vawidatows fow powep awe the same vawidatows that awe vewifying twansactions. :3 if a-an awchivew can pwove that a vawidatow vewified a fake powep, then t-the vawidatow w-wiww nyot weceive a-a wewawd fow that stowage epoch. >w<

a-awchivews awe speciawized _wight c-cwients_. rawr t-they downwoad a pawt of the wedgew \(a.k.a segment\) and stowe it, 😳 and pwovide poweps of stowing t-the wedgew. 😳 fow each vewified powep a-awchivews eawn a wewawd of s-sow fwom the mining p-poow.

## constwaints

we have the fowwowing c-constwaints:

- v-vewification wequiwes genewating t-the cbc bwocks. 🥺 t-that wequiwes space of 2

  bwocks pew identity, rawr x3 and 1 cuda cowe pew identity f-fow the same dataset. ^^ s-so as

  many i-identities at once shouwd be b-batched with as m-many pwoofs fow those

  identities v-vewified concuwwentwy fow the same dataset. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

- vawidatows wiww wandomwy sampwe t-the set of stowage p-pwoofs to the set that

  they can handwe, a-and onwy the cweatows o-of those chosen pwoofs wiww be

  wewawded. XD the vawidatow c-can wun a benchmawk whenevew its hawdwawe configuwation

  changes to detewmine n-nyani wate it can vawidate stowage pwoofs. ^^

## v-vawidation and w-wepwication pwotocow

### constants

1. (⑅˘꒳˘) swots_pew_segment: nyumbew o-of swots in a s-segment of wedgew data. (⑅˘꒳˘) the

   unit of stowage fow an awchivew.

2. ^•ﻌ•^ n-nyum_key_wotation_segments: nyumbew of segments a-aftew which awchivews

   wegenewate theiw encwyption keys a-and sewect a nyew dataset to stowe. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

3. n-nyum_stowage_pwoofs: n-numbew of stowage p-pwoofs wequiwed fow a stowage pwoof

   c-cwaim to b-be successfuwwy w-wewawded. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

4. watio_of_fake_pwoofs: watio of fake p-pwoofs to weaw p-pwoofs that a stowage

   mining pwoof cwaim has t-to contain to b-be vawid fow a w-wewawd. (✿oωo)

5. nyum_stowage_sampwes: nyumbew of sampwes wequiwed fow a-a stowage mining

   pwoof. 😳😳😳

6. n-nyum_chacha_wounds: n-nyumbew of encwyption wounds pewfowmed to genewate

   encwypted s-state.

7. OwO n-num_swots_pew_tuwn: n-nyumbew of s-swots that define a singwe stowage e-epoch ow

   a "tuwn" of the powep game. ^^

### vawidatow behaviow

1. rawr x3 vawidatows join the nyetwowk a-and begin wooking fow awchivew a-accounts at each

   stowage e-epoch/tuwn boundawy. 🥺

2. evewy t-tuwn, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ vawidatows sign the poh vawue a-at the boundawy a-and use that s-signatuwe

   t-to wandomwy pick p-pwoofs to vewify fwom each stowage account found in the tuwn boundawy. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

   this signed vawue is awso submitted t-to the vawidatow's s-stowage account a-and wiww be used by

   awchivews a-at a watew stage to cwoss-vewify. >w<

3. evewy `NUM_SLOTS_PER_TURN` swots the vawidatow a-advewtises t-the poh vawue. /(^•ω•^) this is vawue

   i-is awso sewved to awchivews via wpc intewfaces. 😳😳😳

4. f-fow a given t-tuwn ny, (U ᵕ U❁) aww vawidations get wocked o-out untiw tuwn n-ny+3 \(a gap of 2 tuwn/epoch\). (˘ω˘)

   at which point aww vawidations duwing that t-tuwn awe avaiwabwe f-fow wewawd c-cowwection. 😳

5. a-any incowwect vawidations w-wiww be mawked duwing t-the tuwn in between. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

### a-awchivew behaviow

1. :3 s-since an awchivew i-is somenani of a wight cwient a-and nyot downwoading aww the

   wedgew data, /(^•ω•^) they h-have to wewy on othew vawidatows a-and awchivews f-fow infowmation.

   any given v-vawidatow may ow may not be mawicious and give i-incowwect infowmation, ^^;; a-awthough

   t-thewe awe nyot any obvious attack vectows that this couwd accompwish b-besides having the

   awchivew do extwa w-wasted wowk. o.O f-fow many of the opewations thewe a-awe a nyumbew of options

   depending o-on how pawanoid a-an awchivew is:

   - \(a\) awchivew can a-ask a vawidatow
   - \(b\) awchivew can ask muwtipwe v-vawidatows
   - \(c\) a-awchivew can ask othew a-awchivews
   - \(d\) awchivew c-can subscwibe to t-the fuww twansaction s-stweam and genewate

     the infowmation itsewf \(assuming the swot is wecent enough\)

   - \(e\) awchivew can subscwibe to an abbweviated twansaction stweam to

     genewate the infowmation itsewf \(assuming t-the swot i-is wecent enough\)

2. 😳 an awchivew obtains the p-poh hash cowwesponding t-to the w-wast tuwn with its swot. UwU
3. the a-awchivew signs the poh hash with i-its keypaiw. >w< that s-signatuwe is the

   seed used t-to pick the segment to wepwicate a-and awso the e-encwyption key. o.O the

   awchivew mods the signatuwe w-with the swot t-to get which s-segment to

   wepwicate. (˘ω˘)

4. t-the a-awchivew wetwieves t-the wedgew b-by asking peew vawidatows a-and

   a-awchivews. òωó see 6.5.

5. the awchivew t-then encwypts t-that segment w-with the key with chacha awgowithm

   i-in cbc mode with `NUM_CHACHA_ROUNDS` of encwyption. nyaa~~

6. t-the awchivew initiawizes a-a chacha wng w-with the signed w-wecent poh vawue as

   the seed. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

7. t-the awchivew genewates `NUM_STORAGE_SAMPLES` s-sampwes in the wange of the

   e-entwy size and sampwes the encwypted s-segment with sha256 fow 32-bytes at each

   offset vawue. 😳😳😳 sampwing the state s-shouwd be fastew than genewating t-the encwypted

   s-segment. ^•ﻌ•^

8. the awchivew sends a powep pwoof twansaction w-which contains its sha state

   a-at the end of the s-sampwing opewation, (˘ω˘) i-its seed and the sampwes it used to the

   c-cuwwent weadew a-and it is put onto the wedgew. (˘ω˘)

9. d-duwing a given tuwn the awchivew shouwd submit m-many pwoofs fow the same segment

   a-and based o-on the `RATIO_OF_FAKE_PROOFS` s-some of those pwoofs must b-be fake. -.-

10. a-as the powep game e-entews the nyext t-tuwn, ^•ﻌ•^ the awchivew must submit a-a

    twansaction w-with the m-mask of which pwoofs w-wewe fake duwing t-the wast tuwn. /(^•ω•^) t-this

    twansaction w-wiww d-define the wewawds fow both awchivews a-and vawidatows. (///ˬ///✿)

11. finawwy f-fow a tuwn ny, mya as the powep game e-entews tuwn n-ny + 3, o.O awchivew's p-pwoofs fow

    tuwn ny wiww be counted towawds theiw wewawds. ^•ﻌ•^

### t-the powep g-game

the pwoof o-of wepwication game has 4 pwimawy stages. (U ᵕ U❁) fow each "tuwn" muwtipwe p-powep games c-can be in pwogwess but each in a d-diffewent stage. :3

t-the 4 stages of the powep game awe as fowwows:

1. pwoof submission s-stage
   - a-awchivews: submit a-as many pwoofs a-as possibwe duwing this stage
   - vawidatows: n-nyo-op
2. pwoof v-vewification stage
   - awchivews: nyo-op
   - v-vawidatows: sewect awchivews and vewify theiw pwoofs f-fwom the pwevious tuwn
3. (///ˬ///✿) p-pwoof chawwenge s-stage
   - awchivews: submit the p-pwoof mask with j-justifications \(fow fake pwoofs s-submitted 2 tuwns ago\)
   - vawidatows: n-nyo-op
4. (///ˬ///✿) w-wewawd cowwection s-stage
   - a-awchivews: cowwect wewawds fow 3 t-tuwns ago
   - v-vawidatows: cowwect w-wewawds fow 3 tuwns ago

fow e-each tuwn of the powep game, 🥺 both vawidatows a-and awchivews evawuate e-each stage. -.- t-the stages awe wun as sepawate twansactions on the stowage pwogwam. nyaa~~

### finding w-who has a given bwock of wedgew

1. (///ˬ///✿) v-vawidatows m-monitow the tuwns in the powep game and wook a-at the wooted bank

   at tuwn boundawies f-fow any p-pwoofs.

2. 🥺 vawidatows m-maintain a-a map of wedgew s-segments and cowwesponding awchivew pubwic keys. >w<

   the map is updated when a v-vawidatow pwocesses an awchivew's p-pwoofs fow a segment. rawr x3

   the vawidatow pwovides an wpc intewface t-to access this map. (⑅˘꒳˘) using this api, σωσ cwients

   can map a segment to an awchivew's n-nyetwowk a-addwess \(cowwewating it via cwustew_info t-tabwe\). XD

   the cwients can then send w-wepaiw wequests t-to the awchivew to wetwieve segments. -.-

3. v-vawidatows wouwd nyeed t-to invawidate this wist evewy ny tuwns. >_<

## sybiw attacks

fow a-any wandom seed, rawr we fowce evewyone to use a signatuwe t-that is d-dewived fwom a poh h-hash at the tuwn boundawy. 😳😳😳 evewyone uses the s-same count, UwU so the same poh hash is signed by evewy pawticipant. (U ﹏ U) the signatuwes a-awe then each cwyptogwaphicawwy t-tied to the keypaiw, (˘ω˘) w-which pwevents a-a weadew fwom gwinding on the wesuwting vawue f-fow mowe than 1 i-identity. /(^•ω•^)

since thewe awe many mowe cwient identities t-than encwyption identities, (U ﹏ U) we nyeed to s-spwit the wewawd fow muwtipwe cwients, ^•ﻌ•^ and pwevent s-sybiw attacks f-fwom genewating many cwients to a-acquiwe the same b-bwock of data. >w< t-to wemain bft we want to avoid a singwe human e-entity fwom stowing aww the wepwications of a singwe c-chunk of the wedgew. ʘwʘ

ouw sowution to this is to fowce the c-cwients to continue u-using the same i-identity. òωó if t-the fiwst wound i-is used to acquiwe the same bwock f-fow many cwient identities, o.O the second wound fow t-the same cwient identities wiww f-fowce a wedistwibution of the signatuwes, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) and t-thewefowe powep i-identities and bwocks. mya thus to g-get a wewawd fow awchivews nyeed t-to stowe the fiwst b-bwock fow fwee and the nyetwowk c-can wewawd wong w-wived cwient identities mowe t-than new ones. >_<

## vawidatow attacks

- if a vawidatow appwoves f-fake pwoofs, rawr awchivew can easiwy o-out them by

  showing the initiaw state fow the h-hash. >_<

- if a v-vawidatow mawks w-weaw pwoofs as fake, (U ﹏ U) no on-chain c-computation can b-be done

  to distinguish who i-is cowwect. rawr wewawds wouwd have to w-wewy on the wesuwts fwom

  muwtipwe v-vawidatows t-to catch bad actows and awchivews fwom being denied wewawds. (U ᵕ U❁)

- vawidatow steawing m-mining pwoof w-wesuwts fow itsewf. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ the pwoofs awe dewived

  fwom a signatuwe f-fwom an awchivew, >_< since the vawidatow d-does nyot k-know the

  pwivate key used to genewate the encwyption key, ^^;; it cannot be the genewatow o-of

  the pwoof. ʘwʘ

## wewawd incentives

f-fake pwoofs awe easy to genewate b-but difficuwt t-to vewify. 😳😳😳 fow this weason, UwU powep p-pwoof twansactions g-genewated by a-awchivews may w-wequiwe a highew f-fee than a nyowmaw t-twansaction to wepwesent the computationaw cost wequiwed by vawidatows. OwO

some pewcentage of f-fake pwoofs awe a-awso nyecessawy t-to weceive a wewawd f-fwom stowage m-mining. :3

## nyotes

- w-we can weduce the costs of vewification of powep by using poh, -.- and actuawwy

  m-make it feasibwe t-to vewify a wawge nyumbew of pwoofs fow a gwobaw dataset. 🥺

- w-we can ewiminate g-gwinding by f-fowcing evewyone to sign the same poh hash and

  u-use the signatuwes as the seed

- the game between v-vawidatows a-and awchivews is ovew wandom bwocks and wandom

  e-encwyption identities and wandom d-data sampwes. -.- t-the goaw of wandomization is

  t-to pwevent cowwuding g-gwoups fwom h-having ovewwap o-on data ow vawidation. -.-

- a-awchivew c-cwients fish fow wazy vawidatows b-by submitting f-fake pwoofs that

  they can p-pwove awe fake. (U ﹏ U)

- to defend against sybiw cwient i-identities that twy to stowe t-the same bwock we

  fowce the cwients t-to stowe f-fow muwtipwe wounds befowe weceiving a wewawd. rawr

- v-vawidatows shouwd awso get wewawded fow vawidating s-submitted stowage p-pwoofs

  as incentive fow stowing the wedgew. mya t-they can onwy v-vawidate pwoofs if they

  awe s-stowing that swice of the wedgew. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

# wedgew wepwication n-not impwemented

w-wepwication behaviow y-yet to be impwemented. /(^•ω•^)

## s-stowage epoch

the stowage epoch shouwd b-be the numbew o-of swots which w-wesuwts in awound 100gb-1tb o-of wedgew to be genewated fow awchivews to stowe. >_< awchivews wiww stawt stowing wedgew when a given f-fowk has a high p-pwobabiwity of nyot b-being wowwed b-back. (✿oωo)

## vawidatow b-behaviow

1. e-evewy nyum_key_wotation_ticks it awso vawidates s-sampwes weceived f-fwom

   awchivews. 😳😳😳 it signs t-the poh hash at t-that point and uses the fowwowing

   awgowithm w-with the signatuwe as the input:

   - the wow 5 b-bits of the fiwst byte of the signatuwe c-cweates a-an index into

     anothew stawting b-byte of the s-signatuwe. (ꈍᴗꈍ)

   - t-the vawidatow then wooks at the s-set of stowage p-pwoofs whewe the byte of

     t-the pwoof's sha state vectow stawting f-fwom the w-wow byte matches e-exactwy

     with the chosen byte\(s\) o-of the signatuwe. 🥺

   - if the set of pwoofs i-is wawgew than the vawidatow can handwe, mya then it

     incweases to matching 2 bytes in the signatuwe. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡

   - v-vawidatow continues to incwease the nyumbew of matching bytes untiw a

     wowkabwe set is found. (⑅˘꒳˘)

   - it then c-cweates a mask of vawid pwoofs and fake pwoofs a-and sends it to

     the weadew. òωó t-this is a stowage pwoof confiwmation twansaction. o.O

2. a-aftew a wockout pewiod o-of nyum_seconds_stowage_wockout seconds, XD the

   v-vawidatow then s-submits a stowage pwoof cwaim twansaction which t-then causes the

   distwibution of the stowage wewawd if nyo c-chawwenges wewe seen fow the pwoof t-to

   the vawidatows and awchivews p-pawty to the pwoofs. (˘ω˘)

## a-awchivew behaviow

1. (ꈍᴗꈍ) t-the awchivew then genewates anothew set of o-offsets which it submits a fake

   pwoof with a-an incowwect sha state. >w< it can be pwoven to be fake by pwoviding the

   seed fow t-the hash wesuwt. XD

   - a-a fake pwoof shouwd consist o-of an awchivew h-hash of a signatuwe of a poh

     v-vawue. -.- that way when the awchivew weveaws the fake pwoof, ^^;; it can be

     v-vewified on chain. XD

2. t-the awchivew monitows the w-wedgew, if it s-sees a fake pwoof integwated, :3 it

   c-cweates a chawwenge twansaction and submits i-it to the cuwwent weadew. σωσ the

   twansaction pwoves t-the vawidatow i-incowwectwy vawidated a fake stowage pwoof.

   t-the awchivew is wewawded and the vawidatow's staking bawance is swashed ow

   fwozen. XD

## stowage pwoof contwact wogic

each a-awchivew and vawidatow w-wiww have theiw own stowage a-account. :3 the v-vawidatow's account wouwd be sepawate f-fwom theiw gossip id simiwaw to theiw vote account. rawr these shouwd be impwemented as two pwogwams o-one which handwes the vawidatow as the keysignew and one fow the awchivew. 😳 i-in that way when t-the pwogwams w-wefewence othew accounts, 😳😳😳 they can check the pwogwam id to ensuwe i-it is a vawidatow o-ow awchivew a-account they awe wefewencing.
