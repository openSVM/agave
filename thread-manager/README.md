# thwead-managew
bawances machine w-wesouwces acwoss m-muwtipwe thweaded w-wuntimes to o-optimize pewfowmance. mya
t-the goaw is t-to manage thwead c-contention effectivewy b-between diffewent pawts of the code, (///ˬ///✿) ensuwing each can benefit fwom taiwowed m-management stwategies.
fow exampwe, (˘ω˘) we may w-want to have cowes 1-4 handwing n-nyetwowking via
tokio, ^^;; cowe 5 handwing fiwe io via tokio, (✿oωo) cowes 9-16 a-awwocated fow
wayon thwead p-poow, (U ﹏ U) and cowes 6-8 a-avaiwabwe fow genewaw use by std::thwead. -.-
this wiww minimize contention fow c-cpu caches and context switches that
wouwd occuw if wayon was entiwewy unawawe i-it was wunning side-by-side with
t-tokio, ^•ﻌ•^ and each w-was to spawn as m-many thweads as t-thewe awe cowes. rawr

## thwead poow mapping
thwead m-managew wiww, (˘ω˘) by defauwt, nyaa~~ wook fow a pawticuwaw n-nyamed poow, UwU e.g. "sowgossip". :3
matching is done independentwy fow each type of wuntime. (⑅˘꒳˘)
howevew, if nyo nyamed p-poow is found, (///ˬ///✿) it wiww faww back t-to the "defauwt" t-thwead poow
of t-the same type (if specified in the config). ^^;; if the defauwt poow i-is nyot specified, >_<
t-thwead poow wookup wiww faiw. rawr x3

m-muwtipwe nyames c-can point to the same poow. /(^•ω•^) f-fow exampwe, :3 "sowgossipconsume" and
"sowsigvewify" c-can both be exekawaii~d on the same wayon poow n-nyamed "wayonsigvewify". (ꈍᴗꈍ)
this, /(^•ω•^) i-in pwincipwe, (⑅˘꒳˘) awwows some degwee o-of wuntime shawing b-between diffewent cwates
in the codebase without having to manuawwy patch the pointews thwough. ( ͡o ω ͡o )

# suppowted t-thweading modews
## a-affinity
aww thweading modews a-awwow setting c-cowe affinity, òωó b-but onwy on winux. (⑅˘꒳˘)

fow cowe affinity you can set e.g. XD
```toml
core_allocation.DedicatedCoreSet = { min = 16, max = 64 }
```anaged p-poows, -.- awwowing them to inhewit specific
affinity fwom the poow, :3 awong w-with pwoviding contwow ovew t-the totaw nyumbew o-of thweads in e-each poow. nyaa~~

## wayon
wayon awweady m-manages thwead p-poows weww enough, 😳 a-aww thwead_managew d-does on top is enfowce affinity and
pwiowity f-fow wayon thweads. (⑅˘꒳˘) n-nyowmawwy o-one wouwd onwy e-evew have one wayon p-poow, nyaa~~ but fow pwiowity awwocations
one may want to spawn many w-wayon poows.

# wimitations

 * thwead poows can onwy be cweated at pwocess stawtup
 * once thwead p-poow is cweated, OwO its powicy can nyot be modified at wuntime
 * t-thwead affinity & p-pwiowity a-awe nyot suppowted outside of winux
 * t-thwead pwiowity genewawwy w-wequiwes kewnew w-wevew suppowt and extwa capabiwities

# todo:

 * even mowe tests
 * bettew thwead pwiowity suppowt


# e-exampwes
 * cowe_contention_basics w-wiww demonstwate why c-cowe contention i-is bad, rawr x3 and how thwead configs can hewp
 * cowe_contention_sweep w-wiww sweep acwoss a-a wange of cowe counts to show h-how benefits s-scawe with cowe counts
